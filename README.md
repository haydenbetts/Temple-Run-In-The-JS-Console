# Temple Run Clone in the Javascript Console
A hackathon project built around the concept of using `console.clear` and `console.log` to simulate animation inside of a javascript console. I cover the method in-depth in a blog-post [here](https://medium.com/@hayden_betts/building-a-temple-run-clone-that-runs-in-the-javascript-console-b3481f9b9199).
